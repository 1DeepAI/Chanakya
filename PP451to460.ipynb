    "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an advanced field within Deep Learning which aims to automate the design of neural network architectures. This can be very computationally intensive. For a full-scale implementation, tools like Google's AutoML or Uber's Ludwig might be used. Here, I'll provide a simpler, illustrative example using a population-based approach.\n",

    "Firstly, let's define the setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population-Based Training (PBT): Instead of having a population of architectures that evolve, PBT trains models and replaces under-performing models with better ones, while also introducing variations.\n",

    "  Note: This is a basic illustrative example. In practice, NAS can be much more complex, especially when using tools specifically built for it. Also, training architectures can be computationally expensive, so consider running on GPUs and adjusting the parameters for your data and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Expected Output: Given the nature of the problem (i.e., searching architectures and training neural networks), the exact output may vary each time due to randomness in the initial architectures and in training dynamics. However, after running the PBT_NAS function, you should expect an output similar to the following:\n",

    "### 455. Implement a Transfer Learning Model with Domain Generalization and Custom Domain Alignment\n",
    "To create a transfer learning model with domain generalization. The primary idea behind domain generalization is to learn features that are invariant across multiple domains such that the model performs well on a previously unseen domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define multiple source domains.\n",
    "Use feature extractors and domain alignment mechanisms to learn domain-invariant features.\n",
    "Train a classifier on top of the feature extractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, I'll use TensorFlow and Keras. We will simulate data from multiple domains. In practice, this could be images from different datasets or data collected under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is a rudimentary setup for illustrative purposes. Real-world domain generalization tasks may require much more extensive preprocessing, larger datasets, and more sophisticated models and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output: \n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "The training statistics show the progress for each epoch as the model trains on domain_1. You see the loss and accuracy for both the training and validation sets (x_test and y_test).\n",
    "After training, the model is evaluated on domain_2 to showcase its generalization capability on a domain it hasn't seen during training. The evaluation metrics, i.e., loss and accuracy, for this domain are printed.\n",
    "The final line \"Domain 2 accuracy: 44.93%\" indicates the model's performance on domain_2. Given the simplicity of the domain alignment method used, the accuracy is likely much lower than the training domain, which is expected. In real-world scenarios, a more advanced domain alignment technique would likely yield better results.\n",
    "This is a simulated scenario, so the actual numbers can vary based on factors like the random initialization of weights, the noise added to simulate domains, etc."
