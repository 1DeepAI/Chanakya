    "A Reuleaux hexagon is not a traditional geometric shape. However, for the sake of this problem, we'll make an assumption. A Reuleaux hexagon, similar to a Reuleaux triangle, would be a shape formed from the intersections of six circles with the same radius, placed at the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n",

    "- Custom Side Lengths: Adjust the side_length parameter.\n",
    "- Variable Base: The base is inferred as the flat side of the shape, and its length is side_length.\n",
    "- Custom Position: For the calculation, this doesn't affect the result. It would be considered if we were to draw the shape.\n",
    "- Custom Border: Again, this doesn't affect the calculation but would be taken into consideration if drawing the shape.\n",
